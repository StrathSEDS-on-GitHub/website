                At StrathSEDS, we are looking to design and build a 2-stage rocket that will compete in the Mach-24 rocketry competition held in July. Our mission, ‘Clyde-o-scope’, will see our rocket, Strathosphere III, lift off with a goal of reaching 3km. Not only are we competing to achieve an altitude target, but the rocket will also be equipped with a >1kg CanSat which is being designed to measure altitude using the speed of sound. Our plan is to use a two-stage recovery system on the launch vehicle (LV) to minimise drift from the launch site and furthermore, we are hoping to show a livestream from the LV during flight.</p><br>
                
                <p>We have further goals within the society for this project and this includes using recycled plastics for 3D-printed components, relaying live telemetry data as well as video feeds to Twitch and using edge machine learning to analyse video footage from the LV to learn about flexural-torsional flutter for future missions. We are determined to make this project a success as it shows growth within the society. Our project team is split into 3 sub-teams: mechanical, electrical, and coding. Each team plays a crucial role in the development of our rockets. We have taken part in various competitions in the past with various amounts of success but consistently competing to a high level sets a good benchmark for how we want the society to be seen within the community. Through a wider lens, our objectives are more long-term. What this means is that we wish to help produce the next generation of rocket engineers. The rockets we design are entirely student led and we believe this to be a core principle of the society. Inclusivity and diversity are big parts of our identity and collaboration as well; we are not just comprised of traditional engineers, but we believe no matter your background, you can help contribute to the team.  </p><br>

                <p>The University of Strathclyde is already renowned for producing top engineering talents but the students in our society are given an edge due to their hands-on experience with all aspects of rocketry design. All our sub teams work together under the same roof encouraging conversations to take place between them. We believe word of mouth to be one of the strongest tools at our disposal and teaching the students to talk to each other to solve problems is key. This type of experience is harder to obtain from just the university course alone.  </p><br>

<p>Our society is already recognised by the University for having great prestige and we have multiple ties with outside international corporations. This year, we partnered with ANSYS who are well-known for their expertise in software simulation partnering with many Formula 1 teams and now helping us to simulate the aerodynamic effects on our rocket. Ultimately, the industry is only as good as the people in it and we aim to prepare our members for this to the best of our abilities </p><br>

As we look to expand our aspirations, we will also be entering into a secondary rocketry competition, the National Rockery Championship (NRC). We are returning to this competition for the first time in over a decade as we look to grow as a society. This competition allows more junior members of the society to design and build rocket parts and we wish to facilitate all our members goals. Our rocket for this competition will aim to reach an altitude of 762m and upon parachute deployment, will measure the load forces in the parachute lines. 

Methodology 

The mechanical team is currently working on… 

The electrical team is currently working on… 

The coding team is currently working on… 

Product 

From the RS store, we will be looking to buy…  

Next Steps 

Looking to the future, we will continue to work on Strathosphere III. The parts that will be provided by RS will be a massive aid in turning our dreams into reality. There will be several challenges as we are still restricted by the budget we are working with. We are also restricted by the amount of time we have until launch. Being university students, we cannot dedicate all our time to the mission as this has to be balanced with coursework and personal lives.  

We are a positive group of people; we believe in the talent that we have within the society and that the future is still to be written. Success for us looks like the clock hitting T-0, and a rocket launching with each of the components working as it should. Success is the improvements we can take from this into next years design. Success is everyone within the society feeling a sense of pride in what they do. That is StrathSEDS. </p>
